The visualization part is implemented using [D3] (http://d3js.org/), and the functionality of tracking time is modified from [browser-time-tracker](https://github.com/navjagpal/browser-timetracker/)

## Installation

I plan not to publish this extension to chrome store, but you can download it by pasting this link to your brower
